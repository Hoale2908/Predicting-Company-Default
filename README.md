# Predicting Company Default
This model predicts whether a company will default based on its fundamental financial information.
The training data includes historical financial ratios and default events of public companies over the 1995-2004 period.

In summary, the author developed and validated different models using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting techniques. AUC-ROC and accuracy were used for performance evaluation. Accordingly, a Gradient Boosted Tree model trained on oversampled data was chosen as the best one overall.

# Predicting Company Default
This model predicts whether companies will default given based on their fundamental financial information.
The data used for training includes historical financial ratios and default events of public companies over the 1995-2004 period.

In summary, the author developed and validated some models using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting technique. AUC-ROC and accuracy were used to evaluate model performance. Accordingly, a Gradient Boosted Tree model trained on oversampled data was chosen as the best one overall.
